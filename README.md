## Hey there! I'm Suresh Rawat 👋

Ever since I wrote my first line of code and later decoded my first balance sheet, I knew I was meant to live at the intersection of **business and technology**.

I’m an **Aspiring Business Analyst** with a background in **Computer Science** and an **MBA in Finance & Business Analysis**. That’s right — I speak both binary and balance sheets. My journey so far has been all about solving problems, understanding systems, and using data to guide better decisions.
